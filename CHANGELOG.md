- **Flowchart direction fix** - Respect LR/TB/RL/BT direction keywords in layout algorithm
- **Node detection fixes** - Fix missing nodes and improve branching layout in complex flowcharts
- **YAML frontmatter support** - Parse `---` metadata blocks with `title:`, `config:` etc. (MermaidJS v8.13+ syntax)
- **Parallel edge operator** - Support `A --> B & C & D` syntax for multiple edges from one source
- **Rendering performance** - AST and layout caching with blake3 hashing for complex diagrams
- **classDef/class styling** - Node styling via `classDef` and `class` directives

#### Split View Enhancements
- **Dual editable panes** - Split view rendered pane is now fully editable, matching full Rendered mode behavior
- Both panes edit the same content with changes syncing instantly
- Full undo/redo support for edits in either pane

#### Git Integration
- **Git status auto-refresh** - Automatic refresh of file tree git badges on file save, window focus, periodic interval (10 seconds), and file system events
- **Debounced refresh** - 500ms debounce prevents excessive git2 calls during rapid operations

#### CSV Support ([#19](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/19))
- **CSV/TSV viewer** - Native table view for CSV and TSV files with fixed-width column alignment
- **Rainbow column coloring** - Alternating column colors for improved readability

#### Internationalization ([#18](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/18))
- **i18n infrastructure** - YAML translation files in `locales/` directory with rust-i18n integration
- **Weblate integration** - Community translations via [hosted.weblate.org/projects/ferrite](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ferrite/)
- **String extraction** - UI strings moved to translation keys

#### CJK Writing Conventions ([#20](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/20))
- **Paragraph indentation** - First-line indentation setting for Chinese (2 chars), Japanese (1 char), or custom
- **Rendered view support** - Apply `text-indent` styling to paragraphs in preview mode

#### New Features
- **Keyboard shortcut customization** - Users can rebind shortcuts via settings panel; stored in config.json
- **Custom font selection** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Select preferred font for editor and UI; important for CJK regional glyph preferences
- **Semantic minimap header labels** - Display actual H1/H2/H3 text in minimap instead of unreadable scaled pixels
- **Main menu UI redesign** - Modernized main menu with improved layout and visual design

#### Branding
- **New Ferrite logo** - Orange geometric crystal icon
- **Platform icons** - Windows `.ico`, macOS `.iconset`, Linux PNGs (16-512px)
- **Window icon** - Embedded 256px icon replaces default eframe "E" logo

### Fixed

#### Bug Fixes
- **Search highlight drift** - Fixed find/search highlight boxes drifting progressively further from matched text; caused by byte vs character position mismatch in UTF-8 text
- **Config.json persistence** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Fixed window state dirty flag; settings now persist correctly across restarts
- **Line width in rendered/split view** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Line width setting now respects pane boundaries with proper centering behavior
- **Quick switcher mouse support** - Fixed mouse hover/click not working (item flickering but not selecting)
- **Table editing cursor loss** - Table cells no longer lose focus after each keystroke in Rendered/Split modes; edits are buffered and committed when focus leaves (deferred update model)

- **Windows top edge resize** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Window can now be resized from all edges including top
- **macOS Intel CPU optimization** ([#24](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/24)) - Idle repaint scheduling reduces CPU usage on Intel Macs

### Technical
- Split `mermaid.rs` into modular structure: `src/markdown/mermaid/` with `mod.rs`, `flowchart.rs`, `sequence.rs`, etc.
- Added `GitAutoRefresh` struct for managing refresh timing and focus tracking
- Added `had_focus_last_frame` and `content_modified` fields to `TableEditState` for focus tracking
- Added blake3 hashing for Mermaid diagram caching
- Added 11 unit tests for git auto-refresh logic
- Added comprehensive technical documentation in `docs/technical/`

### Deferred

## [0.2.3] - 2025-01-12

### Added

#### Editor Productivity
